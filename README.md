This is an Calculator Template that only contains HTML and CSS. 
Great for starters, i think this would be useful for someone who just wants to try HTML or CSS.
NOTE: If you want to have a custoÄ‘ font in your project, then add:
@import url {'the embed link of the font'}
in the style.css of your project.
